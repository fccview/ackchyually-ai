# Contributing

Anyone can contribute of course, as long as you keep to the spirit of the project.

- Please don't create overly complex pull requests, this is meant to be AND stay simple.

- DO NOT USE AI, I normally don't mind, you can use AI for any of my other projects, but not this one. This is my escape from it, don't ruin it for me.

- Feel free to add new exciting patterns that I may have missed to figure out if something is AI generated, just make sure to avoid repetition, double check if something is already been used.

- Kinda redundant to mention, but please don't use heavy libraries/frameworks.
